## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

On this project i learnt more about CSS and how to move around it, the first two challenges were really a stepping stone for me as i was still finding my feet in terms of styling and the feedback i got really helped broadening the horizon. I am still learning and have a long way to go but with the changes i am seeing i am really happy with them. 

### Continued development

Build more projects that use CSS grid, flex box and others so as to understand it more and have a depper understanding to how it works.
